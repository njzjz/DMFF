# 2. Installation
## 2.1 Install DMFF from conda-forge

One can use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) to install DMFF from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/):

```sh
conda create -n dmff dmff -c conda-forge --yes
```

## 2.2 Test Installation
To test if DMFF is correctly installed, you can run the following commands in an interactive python session:
```python
>>> import dmff
>>> import dmff.admp
```

You can also run the example scripts to test whether DMFF is installed correctly.
```bash
cd ./examples/water_fullpol
python ./run.py

```
Note that the scripts will run slower than expect if `DO_JIT = True` in `dmff/settings.py`. This is because the programm will do the jit compilation when a function is invoked in the first time.
